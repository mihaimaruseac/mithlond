mithlond.ro
===========

This is the source code for [my personal blog](blog). It uses [Hakyll](hakyll)
and [Haskell](haskell) as I managed to get all the things I wanted my blog to
have implemented on it.

As time progresses, I'll add more and more stuff to the blog engine and if I
need something that Hakyll cannot support (e.g., comments -- but now I have a
solution for that using Hakyll, just need to test it), I'll switch to
[Yesod](yesod) as the basic engine.
