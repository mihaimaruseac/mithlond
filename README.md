Still a **work in progress** that will be updated from time to time.

This is the source code for my personal blog. It uses [Hakyll][hakyll] and
[Haskell][haskell].

It implements all the features I need in a blog, faking a dynamic site by
using static website generators.

As time progresses, I'll add more and more stuff to the blog engine and if I
need something that Hakyll cannot support, I'll switch to [Yesod][yesod] as
the basic engine.
