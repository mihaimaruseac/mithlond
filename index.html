<p>Hi, I'm Mihai, welcoming you to my blog. Here's every post I've ever
written, including those from before this blog was launched (WIP).</p>

<p>At the moment, most of the blog is work in progress, so things are likely
to change as I write more content.</p>

<table class="post-index">
  $for(posts)$
    <tr>
        <td><a href="$url$">$title$</a></td>
        <td class="right"><time>$date$</time></td>
    </tr>
  $endfor$
</table>
