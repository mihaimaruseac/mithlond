<p>Hi! Welcome to my blog. Below, you will see a list of all posts I have ever
written. The presentation and the blog is still work in progress, but I hope
you'll enjoy reading it during this time anyway.</p>

<table class="post-index">
  $for(posts)$
    <tr>
        <td><a href="$url$">$title$</a></td>
        <td class="right"><time>$date$</time></td>
    </tr>
  $endfor$
