<p>Hi! I'm Mihai Maruseac, software engineer with a PhD in location privacy.
This is my personal blog where I post about my trips through the world of
computer science and science in general.</p>

<p>At the moment, most of the blog is work in progress, so things are likely
to change as I write more content and experiment with more features.</p>

<p>Below, you will see a list of all posts I have ever written. At the moment,
they are sorted from the most recent to the latest one but this might change
in the future in two ways: First, I might include promoted posts from my other
blogs I used to write to in the past (no longer accessible to the public, but
the content is still out there). Second, I might provide more ways to organize
the flow of information on this blog, as the experiments I'm working on will
produce satisfactory results. Until then, enjoy the posts from this
listing:</p>

<table class="post-index">
  $for(posts)$
    <tr>
        <td><a href="$url$">$title$</a></td>
        <td class="right"><time>$date$</time></td>
    </tr>
  $endfor$
</table>
