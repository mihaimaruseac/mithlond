In this article, I want to give some details about this blog, its history and
the technology and design choices behind it. This article will change
every time something about the blog does: be it changing the URL scheme or
just the CSS, that change will be mentioned here. You might consider this to
be a `CHANGELOG` file, a living history of the changes that this blog has
passed through, from the small ones such as just changing the provided
features or the styling of the elements to really important ones such as
changing back-end or completely rewriting components of the system.

But I'm getting ahead of myself, so we should start in a proper order.
