Welcome. I am Mihai Maruseac, also known as _MM_.

I studied Computer Science at [University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest][acs] (UPB)
where I finished my undergrad by focusing on compilers, operating systems and
AI.  Then, I did a Masters in Artificial Intelligence at the same University.
I concluded my education with a PhD in [Differential Privacy][dp] from
[University of Massachusetts Boston][umb] (UMass Boston, UMB). Although all of
these programs where majoring in Computer Science, there was a deep focus on
Mathematics and this has led to people thinking that I have a minor in
Mathematics. However, there are a lot of areas there where I am still a novice
but I'm exploring them, part of the reason why I have this blog. I also have a
significant background in Physics which I sometimes use in my work.

My main interests are Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining/Data Science,
[Differential Privacy][dp] (DP), and Functional Programming -- with more than
95% of the focus being on Haskell. I tend to use and promote Open Source
software, being a Linux user for more than 10 years -- Fedora user for the
last half of it -- and using Vim to edit anything.

I am involved in the Haskell community being the editor of the [Haskell
Communities and Activities Report][hcar] (HCAR) and being a member of the
[stackage-curator][stackage] and [stack-curator][stack] teams. I sometimes
contribute to the [Stack][stack] Haskell build tool and I intend to invest
more time in contributing to other Haskell projects too. I am also member of
the [ROSEdu][rosedu] and [Softbinator][softbinator] Romanian IT communities.

Besides the Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics interests, I also have a
passion for History, some Philosophy, books and movies. Sometimes I play
boardgames, preferring the strategy-based games to the random-chance ones. I
used to play the [_Pardus_][pardus] space-oriented online game where I tried
to use data science to extract features about the evolution of that world.
That resulted in players giving me the nickname of _Mathman_ which somehow
also got outside the game. Nevertheless, in presence of technical people, I
prefer not to use it as I still have a lot to learn in that field.

In the remainder of this article, I will post a list of all the publications I
have, relevant achievements and other online profiles where people can find me
and I am active.
